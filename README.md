# Bulk Actions for Paint.NET
Bulk Actions plugin for Paint.NET is a fork from Paint.NET Bulk Image Processor by Keith Newton. The original work can be found here:
https://pdnbulkupdater.codeplex.com/

The purpose of this fork is to make this plugin work with Paint.NET 4+

## Bulk actions
Current options:
- Bulk image resize
- Bulk image format change

## Installation
Copy "BulkActionsForPaintDotNet.dll" to Paint.NET "Effects" folders. 
In many cases this is the full path for that folder:
C:\Program Files\paint.net\Effects

After restarting Paint.NET a new menu item ("Bulk Actions...") will appear in the bottom of the "Edit" menu.
